BubbleTea focuses on syntactic minimalism. Code should be simple and fun.

### To-Do
- [ ] Online Playground
- [ ] Bug Fixes
- [X] Better List Support
- [X] Better documentation
- [ ] Proper Examples

BubbleTea is interpreted and dynamically typed, providing accessibility for anyone, BubbleTea closer resembles a scripting language rather than a full programming language.

### **Have fun!**
